<br>This documentation describes the Control Tower for Concourse (Control Tower) software.</br>
Control Tower for Concourse is an opinionated CLI tool to easily deploy Concourse in a single command.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The goal of Control Tower for Concourse is to be the world's easiest way to deploy and operate Concourse CI in production.
In just one command you can deploy a new Concourse environment for your team, on either AWS or GCP.
<br>Your `control-tower` deployment will update itself and self-heal, restoring the underlying VMs if needed.</br>
Using the same command-line tool, you can do things like manage DNS, scale your environment, or manage firewall policy.
<br>CredHub is provided for secrets management and Grafana for viewing your Concourse metrics.</br>
