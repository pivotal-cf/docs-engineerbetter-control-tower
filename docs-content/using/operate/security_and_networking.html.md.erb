##<a id='Configuring SSL Certificates'></a>Configuring SSL Certificates

Deployed Concourses can be accessed via over HTTPS using a
user-provided certificate, or an auto-generated self-signed certificate
if one isn't provided.

**Without custom domain name**

If a custom domain is not used,`control-tower` will generate a self-signed certificate.


**With custom domain name**

  - Automatically generated certificates</br>
    By default control-tower will generate a self-signed certificate using the given domain.</br>
  - User-provided certificates</br>
    Pass the cert and private key as strings using:</br>
      `--tls-cert value`:TLS cert to use with Concourse endpoint `[$TLS_CERT]`</br>
      `--tls-key value`:TLS private key to use with Concourse endpoint `[$TLS_KEY]`</br>

For example:

```sh
$ control-tower deploy \
  --domain chimichanga.engineerbetter.com \
  --tls-cert "$(cat chimichanga.engineerbetter.com.crt)" \
  --tls-key "$(cat chimichanga.engineerbetter.com.key)" \
  my-ci
```



##<a id='Data Encryption'></a>Data Encryption

**Database Encryption**

Database encryption is enabled by default.

**Volume Encryption**

On AWS, EBS volumes are encypted by default.



##<a id='Network Security'></a>Network Security

**Persistent public IP**

Concourse workers are accessible on a single public IP to simplify external security policy.</br>

**Configuring trusted networks**

Control Tower normally allows incoming traffic from any address to reach your web node. You can use the `--allow-ips` flag to add firewall rules to prevent this or set `$ALLOW_IPS` environment variable.

This option takes a comma separated list of values. The default is "0.0.0.0/0".

```sh
$ control-tower deploy --iaas gcp --allow-ips 0.0.0.0/0 <deployment-name>
```
Note: `allow-ips` governs what can access Concourse but not what can access the control plane (i.e. the BOSH director).

To allow traffic from your local machine only, use the command:

```sh
$ control-tower deploy --allow-ips $(dig +short myip.opendns.com@resolver1.opendns.com) --iaas gcp <deployment-name>
```

##<a id='Deploying to custom network ranges'></a>Deploying to custom network ranges

Choose custom IP ranges for a concourse's network, created at deploy time.

**Warning: network ranges cannot be changed after initial deployment.**

You can use the flags below to customise the range of each part of the subnet:

- `--vpc-network-range value`:</br>
Customise the VPC network CIDR to deploy into (required for AWS)`[$VPC_NETWORK_RANGE]`
- `--public-subnet-range value`:</br>
Customise public network CIDR (if IAAS is AWS must be within --vpc-network-range) (required)`[$PUBLIC_SUBNET_RANGE]`</br>
- `--private-subnet-range value`:</br>
Customise private network CIDR (if IAAS is AWS must be within --vpc-network-range) (required)`[$PRIVATE_SUBNET_RANGE]`</br>
- `--rds-subnet-range1 value`:</br>
Customise first rds network CIDR (must be within --vpc-network-range) (required for AWS)`[$RDS_SUBNET_RANGE1]`</br>
- `--rds-subnet-range2 value`:</br>
Customise second rds network CIDR (must be within --vpc-network-range) (required for AWS)`[$RDS_SUBNET_RANGE2]`

  > All the ranges above should be in the CIDR format of IPv4/Mask. The sizes can vary as long as vpc-network-range is big enough to contain all others (in case IAAS is AWS). The smallest CIDR for public and private subnets is a /28. The smallest CIDR for rds1 and rds2 subnets is a /29.

##<a id='Credential Management'></a>Credential Management

Control Tower deploys the [CredHub](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub) service alongside Concourse and configures Concourse to use it.</br>
More detail on how CredHub integrates with Concourse can be found [here](https://concourse-ci.org/creds.html).</br>
You can log into CredHub by running:</br>

```sh
$ eval "$(control-tower info --env --region $region $deployment)"
```
